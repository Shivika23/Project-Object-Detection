            <h3>Object detection model that aims to localize and identify multiple objects in a single image.
                This model is a TensorFlow.js port of the COCO-SSD model. For more information about Tensorflow object
                detection API, check out this readme in 'tensorflow/object_detection'.
                This model detects objects defined in the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale object detection,
                segmentation, and captioning dataset.The model is capable of detecting 80 classes of objects. (SSD
                stands for Single Shot MultiBox Detection).
                This TensorFlow.js model does not require you to know about machine learning. It can take input as any
                browser-based image elements and returns an array of bounding boxes with class name and confidence
                level.There are two main ways to get this model in your JavaScript project: via script tags or by
                installing it from NPM and using a build tool like Parcel, WebPack, or Rollup.
